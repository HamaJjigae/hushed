Day 1-2: Understand Solana Basics & Set Up Development Environment
Goal: Get familiar with Solana and set up your development environment.

What to do:
Read Solana Docs on the basics of the blockchain, accounts, and SPL tokens.
Set up your Solana development environment:
Install Solana CLI and Rust (if you haven’t already).
Install Anchor (if using Anchor for smart contracts).
Set up a local test validator (to test your Solana programs locally before deploying).
Create and fund a wallet to interact with Solana.
Play around with the basic commands (like solana balance, solana transfer).
Outcome: You should have a working Solana dev environment and be comfortable with basic Solana commands.

Day 3-4: Dive into Minting and Token Creation (Solana SPL Tokens)
Goal: Get comfortable with minting tokens and managing accounts.

What to do:
Read about SPL Token creation in the Solana Docs.
Learn how to create a mint and token account in Solana using the spl-token CLI tool.
Practice creating your own SPL token, minting it, and transferring it between accounts.
Optional: Test the creation of tokens using a local Solana testnet.
Outcome: You should be able to mint a Solana token and understand how to interact with tokens on Solana. This gives you the foundation for your token system.

Day 5-6: Solana Smart Contracts (Anchor Framework)
Goal: Set up a basic smart contract (program) on Solana using Anchor.

What to do:
Read through the Anchor Docs to understand the basics of writing and deploying smart contracts on Solana.
Write a simple Anchor program to manage chatrooms (create, mint, etc.).
Deploy this program locally on your devnet.
Test your basic program using Anchor CLI.
Outcome: You should have a simple Anchor program that can handle the chatroom logic and token minting. This is the core functionality that will later be extended to chatroom management.

Day 7-8: Kafka Setup for Chatrooms
Goal: Set up Kafka to manage chatroom state and facilitate message exchange.

What to do:
Get familiar with Kafka basics and how to set up a Kafka producer/consumer (probably using a simple Python or Node.js script).
Create a Kafka topic for each chatroom (i.e., using the chatroomid as the Kafka topic).
Set up a basic consumer for each user to listen to messages in their chatroom topic.
Test Kafka message flow between two users (send a message from User1 to User2).
Outcome: You should be able to send and receive messages in Kafka topics corresponding to chatrooms. Kafka will manage the flow of messages for users in your chat.

Day 9-10: Combine Token Minting with Kafka Chatrooms
Goal: Connect Solana token minting with Kafka chatroom system.

What to do:
Implement logic in your smart contract to mint a token and associate it with a chatroom.
Modify your Kafka system so that only authenticated users (via mint address lookup) can send messages to the Kafka topic.
Integrate the minting and chatroom creation process, so when a user creates a chatroom, the token is minted and tied to the chatroom.
Outcome: You should have the full minting process tied into the Kafka chatroom creation, where users can chat in the Kafka topic once they authenticate via the minted token.

Day 11-12: zk-SNARK Authentication System
Goal: Implement zk-SNARK authentication to log users into the chatroom.

What to do:
Familiarize yourself with zk-SNARK basics and how they work.
Implement the zk-SNARK login process: when users enter their user ID and password, the system should:
Retrieve the stored wallet addresses and hashes.
Use zk-SNARK to prove the user’s identity based on the local stored values without revealing them.
Integrate this with the Kafka chatroom system to ensure users can authenticate and be granted access to their specific chatroom topic.
Outcome: You should have a working zk-SNARK-based login mechanism that uses the locally stored encrypted values for authentication.

Day 13-14: Final Integration and Testing
Goal: Integrate all components and thoroughly test the flow.

What to do:
Combine all parts: minting, Kafka chatroom creation, and zk-SNARK authentication into a unified system.
Test the full flow from:
Creating a chatroom.
Minting a token for the chatroom.
Authenticating users with zk-SNARKs.
Having users send messages through Kafka after successful authentication.
Simulate different scenarios (e.g., creating a new chatroom, logging in with the zk-SNARK, sending messages between users).
Outcome: By the end of the day, the whole system should be functioning together: users can create chatrooms, authenticate via zk-SNARKs, and exchange messages in Kafka topics.
